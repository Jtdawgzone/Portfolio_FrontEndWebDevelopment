# Portfolio Website Mockup

My version of Udacity's Front-End Web Development Project 1 utilizing HTML, CSS, FlexBox, and basic media queries to practice layouts and some responsive design.

## Installation

1. Download my project off of GitHub (Either manually or via forking)
2. Open the "index.html" in your browser of choice
3. Open your browser's development tools
4. Resize the browser window and observe how elements respond to changes automatically or at certain breakpoints

## Post Mortem

I learned a lot for my first Udacity project. The hardest part for me was definitely working with FlexBox. It can be finicky at times, especially with FigureCaptions and wanting the nested images to resize at certain breakpoints. I ran out of time but in the future I definitely plan to 1) Master FlexBox, 2) Dive into learning more about Responsive Images and 3) Adding navigation when you click on my logo in the top left. I'm looking forward to completing Project 2!
